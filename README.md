# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree+ Capstone Project
> This project is designed to predict a stocks closing price based upon previous history for the specific stock. The purpose of the project is to gain an understanding of the research required for mondern manchine learning algorithms. This is a data analysis of stock prices using a RNN-LSTM deep learning technique. 

## Installation
> In order to run the program you will need python installed (preferably 3.5+, although python 2.7+ should work no gurantees :)) You will also need a plethora of python tools in order to get started.  I suggest you go with a distribution like Anaconda or Enthoughts Canopy.  It will make things much easier.  
> The tools you will need to install are as follow: numpy, scipy, sci-kit learn, pandas, jupyter, keras, and tensorflow. 

## Example usage
> Once everything is installed run a jupyter notebook from the directory or navigate once the notebook is open.  Click on Kernel and Click on Restart and Run All Code.  All the code will be run including the training.  Once completed you should be able to import a stock into the system and predict where it will close the next business day.
